## About The Project

Surveying is one of the most cost-effective and efficient methods of sampling for primary research. Thus, be it as a student or staff of NUS, it is commonplace to conduct surveys among the school population. 

Having completed a few modules requiring the collection of primary data ourselves, we grew to understand and share similar frustrations regarding the shortcomings of crafting, publicising and visualising such questionnaires:

* Limited reach to the target audience
* Limited customisability of data visualisation
* Lack of information on the research conduct and/or survey creator(s)
* Lacks ease of tracking of all surveys done or published under NUS

We hope to make surveying a lot more accessible to students and staff in NUS so they can collect results quickly and abundantly within the institution. By designing an integrated surveying platform, we hope to make surveys created/completed by the NUS population a lot more trackable, which opens up possibilities for added features such as a points reward system for survey completions. This can provide more incentive for students to complete surveys and yield more survey results for research.

## Core Features

### User Profile Creation/Authentication
Users must indicate their role in the institution (Student/Staff) as well as their identifying information (Name/Course of Study/Email).

### Survey Creation
Users are able to create surveys and customise the questions based on question type (MCQ, open-ended, long open-ended, etc.).

When crafting surveys, users can choose from various question templates to suit the question type that they need for each survey question.

### Survey Completion
Users are able to view and complete other users’ published surveys. Upon completion of a survey, the application updates the database with the newest findings, such that the survey creator is able to obtain the latest findings from his/her published survey.

### Survey Insights
The application stores the data from all completed surveys, from which graphical insights will be loaded and presented to the user when the user wishes to view the results of  their published survey.

### User Profile Feed
Similar to most social media, surveys published by a user and basic user information will be open for viewing under the user’s profile via the profile feed. Mandatory information to be displayed for a survey will include the survey title and a brief description of the survey. 

### Common Survey Feed
A common survey feed can be accessed by all users to explore published surveys requesting responses within the institution.
